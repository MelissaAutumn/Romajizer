# Romajizer

This plugin attempts to retrieve the first English alias (mostly for Japanese artists.) If that fails and you have 
[pykakasi](https://pykakasi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) installed on your system install of Python it will use
that to transliterate the artist's name. Usually to not-so-great results, but it works enough that I'm okay with it.

Be sure to check out the vgmdb or other sources to double-check any transliteration. 

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing with the transliteration, but it looks ~okay~ enough to me.
